        I began learning frontend and web development in March 2024 after moving
        to Sweden, where I had time to rediscover my interest in tech. With
        access to resources, I quickly became invested in coding and decided to
        pursue a career in the field. Iâ€™m also currently enrolled in a Web Dev
        Bootcamp to continue building my skills and collaborate with others.
        Outside of coding, I enjoy Olympic weightlifting, CrossFit, reading, and
        playing video games.
